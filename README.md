Hello there 👋

I'm Collin, a computer science teacher in Omaha, Nebraska. I teach my students programming in ☕ Java and 🐍 Python and to think computationally.  I love learning for the sake of learning and work to instill that same passion into my students.  

While I'm not lesson planning or grading, I enjoy creating stuff out of code.  

## 📋 Current Goals 

- :calendar: blogging at least once a month.  
- :eyes: look for recent blog posts to ✨ appear ✨ here soon using this: [Adding recently published posts](https://iamdarshshah.hashnode.dev/how-to-add-your-recently-published-articles-to-your-github-profile-readme-using-github-actions)
