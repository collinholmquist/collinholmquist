Hello there 👋

I'm Collin, a computer science teacher in Omaha, Nebraska. I teach my students programming in ☕ Java and 🐍 Python and to think computationally.  I love learning for the sake of learning and work to instill that same passion into my students.  

While I'm not lesson planning or grading, I enjoy creating stuff out of code.
